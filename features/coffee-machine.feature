Feature:
  As a coffee buyer
  I want a basic machine that
  I can put a 10 kr coin in
  and get a black cup of coffee back
  because I crave caffeine.

  Scenario Outline:
    Given that the machine is plugged in
    And that water is available
    And that the machine has enough ground coffee
    And the machine has plastic cups
    When the user inserts a <money1> kr coin
    And the user inserts a <money2> kr coin
    And presses the "start" button
    Then the user recieves <cup> cup of coffee.
